      Hi, I’m Dhanvi Bhat, a resident of Mangalore, currently pursuing my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Dayananda Sagar University,Bangalore,Karnataka. My passion lies in using my skills to tackle real-world challenges and create innovative solutions. Through hands-on experiences and a commitment to learning, I strive to turn ideas into impactful actions.Outside of academics, I enjoy playing chess, as it sharpens my problem-solving abilities. I’m also learning new languages—currently, I’m focused on Japanese. Additionally, I speak several languages, including English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, and Tulu. Music plays a big role in my life, helping me relax and calm my mind.
       My ultimate goal is to continuously grow and make meaningful contributions through creativity, collaboration, and innovation. I’m driven by the desire to develop solutions that leave a lasting impact.
